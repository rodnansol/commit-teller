== Goals

=== Introduction

*Commit Teller* is a fun project created for the *GitHub + DEV 2023 Hackathon*.

The hackathon is based around GitHub Actions, GitHub's CI/CD component and the Codespaces. In the announcement organizers listed multiple categories, and this one fits in the Wacky Wildcards (Build a random app that doesnâ€™t fit into one of the categories above.).

The announcement can be found https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-github-dev-2023-hackathon-4ocn[here].

=== Project

What is the purpose of this project? What can we do with it?

With the dawn of the AI techs, this little tool will help you make your pull requests have some sort of backstory, based on the commits they are containing.

Most pieces of software are not really having documentations, and this tool is not a replacement of documentations, but a fun way to tell the story of the project/software/application via the pull request history and its commits.

With the attached GitHub action you are able to hook it into your pull request lifecycles and at merge time, the action will kick in and will tell you the story of the pull request. You name the mood of the story, it can be funny, kind, strict, documentation like, anything you choose.

== Usage

=== GitHub Actions

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
name: Create story about Pull Request
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed # <.>

jobs:
  create-story-for-pull-request:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Create story for pull request at merge
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true # <.>
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: rodnansol/commit-teller-action@v{action-version} # <.>
        name: Create story
        with:
          version: early-access # <.>
          arguments: create-story -pr ${ISSUE_NUMBER} --owner ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY%/*} --repository ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY#*/} --file-extension ADOC -saf=true # <.>
        env: # <.>
          ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.issue.number }} # <.>
          COMMIT_TELLER_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # <.>
          COMMIT_TELLER_OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }} # <.>
      - name: Commit story changes # <.>
        shell: bash
        env:
          ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
        run: |
          git add *.adoc
          git config --global user.email "${{ secrets.COMMITTER_EMAIL }}"
          git config --global user.name "${{ secrets.COMMITTER_NAME }}"
          git commit -m "Creating story about pull request ${ISSUE_NUMBER}"
          git push origin main

----
<.> Specify the event when the action must be executed, for example when the pull request gets closed (The close event can mean closed manually on the website, or by merging the pull request)
<.> Specify if the action steps must be executed if the code changes are getting merged and not just the pull request is being closed by hand.
<.> Add the `rodnansol/commit-teller-action@v{action-version}` to your action. Check the latest version before doing so https://github.com/rodnansol/commit-teller-action/releases[here].
<.> *Optional* - Specify the version of the CLI tool you want to use.
<.> Specify the command with the flags. Check the available flags <<java-jar,here>>.
<.> Check the customization options <<customizations,here>>.
<.> GitHub action is providing the contextual data which contains the number of the issue/pull request. In the pull request context the issue word is interchangeable.
<.> Specify the GitHub token. GitHub Action will always provide one when running the action, but it must be injected into the action.
<.> Specify the OpenAI's API key. Get one after registration here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
<.> *Optional* - If you want to collect the stories inside your repository do not forget to commit them. Check the available templates <<file-templates,here>>.

More information about the action can be found https://github.com/rodnansol/commit-teller-action[here].

Check the documentations https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#using-the-env-context-to-access-environment-variable-values[here].

[#file-templates]
== File templates

The created stories can be saved into a file in two different formats:

- Markdown - _Default_
- AsciiDoc

The file name format is the following: #<pull-request-number> - <pull-request-title>.<extension>

For example, if you have a pull request with the number of 35 and title "feat(core): GitHub and OpenAI integration" the file name will be: *#1 - feat(core): GitHub and OpenAI integration.md*

The templates are simple:

.Markdown
[source,markdown]
----
## <Pull request title>
<Generated story>
----

.AsciiDoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
== <Pull request title>
<Generated story>
----

[NOTE]
At the moment they are not editable/customizable.
